🚀 MNIST Handwritten Digit ClassificationThis project implements and compares two popular machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—for classifying handwritten digits from the widely-used MNIST dataset.The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being $28 \times 28$ pixels.📋 Project StructureThe core logic is contained within the Python script ml_project11.py.Data Source: The project uses the fetch_openml function to load the 'mnist_784' dataset.Preprocessing: The pixel values are scaled to the range $[0, 1]$ and then, for the SVM model, standardized using StandardScaler.Model Implementation:Logistic Regression: Trained on the full training set.Support Vector Machine (SVM): Trained on a smaller subset of 10,000 samples for efficiency, using an RBF kernel.Evaluation: Model performance is primarily evaluated using Accuracy Score and visualized with a Confusion Matrix.🛠️ RequirementsTo run this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:Bashpip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
🏃 Getting StartedClone the repository:Bashgit clone [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1idaPFa1CopQbbNqhoZ8aLA7nJH33Xl0M?usp=sharing]
cd [MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier]
Run the Python script:Bashpython ml_project11.py
The script will:Load and preprocess the MNIST data.Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.Train the Logistic Regression model and print its accuracy.Train the SVM model (on a subset) and print its accuracy.Display a confusion matrix for the Logistic Regression predictions.Display visualizations of 5 test images along with their predicted and true labels.📊 Results SummaryThe script provides the accuracy for both models. Based on the provided code, you should see output similar to the following (actual values may vary slightly based on environment/library updates):ModelTraining Subset SizeTest Set AccuracyLogistic Regression56,000~ 92.2%Support Vector Machine (RBF)10,000~ 96.6%Note: The SVM's superior performance, even with a smaller training subset, highlights the power of non-linear models like RBF-kernel SVM for image classification tasks.🖼️ Visualizations from the ScriptThe script generates two types of visualizations:1. Confusion Matrix (Logistic Regression Example)This heatmap shows how often the classifier correctly predicts a digit (diagonal) and which digits it confuses with others (off-diagonal).2. Sample PredictionsThe script iterates through the first 5 test samples to visually compare the prediction (Pred) with the ground truth (True)

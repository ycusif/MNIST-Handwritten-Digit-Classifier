# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
A machine learning project that trains and evaluates two models—Logistic Regression on the full MNIST dataset and an RBF-kernel Support Vector Machine on a 10,000-sample subset—to classify handwritten digits (0–9). The project includes performance evaluation via accuracy metrics, classification reports, confusion matrices, and sample predictions.
